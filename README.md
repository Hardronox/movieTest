## Description

Used technologies: React, Redux, redux-saga, reselect, SCSS modules, Jest.

Project is done using modular architecture: all files are splitted by the page 
on which they are used. So for each page we have separate actions/reducers/sagas
and so on. This architecture becomes great when project grows and we have a lot
of functionality.

As I wasn't provided with a movies.json file - I created it myself using online
json generator: https://mockaroo.com/ . This file can be found in src/fixtures.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
